The following project currently functions as a command line tool to generate silly text from songs that can be inputted using an json config file. A sample config file is included.

MusixMatch is a service that provides lyric data, and I have used their API to request this information.  I've used the Python Wrapper 2 to access this API programmatically.  Unfortunately, this service does not return complete lyric information.

Here is a link to the GitHub for the Python wrapper: https://github.com/utstikkar/pyMusiXmatch
Here is a link to the MusixMatch API documentation: https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation

In order to use this program, you will need to set up an account with MusixMatch and set the MUSIXMATCH_API_KEY environment variable to the API key associated with your account.

Currently, test_markov.py shows an example program using the lyricscramble module.

NOTE TO SELF: The current project is SUPER buggy.  Lyric text is currently not parsed correctly; should implement a better solution soon.  I'm still deciding how to treat punctuation.  I am leaning towards stripping all punctuation.  I am sure there are other errors too. Will be implementing unit tests.
