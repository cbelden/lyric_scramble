This is the beginning of a little project I'd like to complete by Jan.  This is the bare-bones-
functionality of what will soon integrate with a web app that will allow users to enter in songs/
genres/artists, and in return, the program will return small phrases based off of the corresponding
lyrics.

For example, if a user inputs the "country genre,", the output phrases would be constructed based
off of the top-40 country list.

Command line example:

user input: "country"
output: ..thinking
output: ..thinking
output: ..thinking
output: "i just put truck in my beer"
output: "daddy bought a huge farm and we all dipped our trucks in beer"
output: "cousin lovin went fishin and saw my girl"
output: "MarkovLyrics - would you like to generate more phrases?"

etc. etc.
